  <img src="../images/chocolatepie.jpg" alt="chocolate pie image">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Homemade old fashioned chocolate pie is a creamy, chocolatey, and wonderfully traditional chocolate pudding dessert recipe topped with a light and fluffy meringue.</p>
  <p>Cream pies are a favorite dessert at potlucks and family gatherings, plus, this one is easy to make and has a rich chocolate flavor.</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>1 whole pie crust, baked and cooled (or can use Oreo or graham cracker crust)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 c. sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 c. cornstarch</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
    <li>3 c. whole milk</li>
    <li>4 whole egg yolks</li>
    <li>6 1/2 oz. weight bittersweet chocolate, chopped finely</li>
    <li>2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 tbsp. butter</li>
    <li>Whipped cream, for serving</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Combine the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium saucepan. Stir or whisk together. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Pour in milk and egg yolks, and whisk together.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Stir over medium heat until the mixture just barely comes to a boil and becomes thick, about 6-8 minutes (maybe less, maybe more; just watch it!) The second it starts to bubble and thicken (note: It should be thick like pudding!) remove it from the heat. Add the chocolate, vanilla, and butter, and stir until everything is beautifully combined.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Pour the pudding into the pie crust (if there is extra, spoon it into small dishes) and place in the fridge to chill for 4 hours uncovered.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Cut into slices and serve with whipped cream!</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
